## Prompt

````
I am trying to create an hover animation for my element. I am using React.

Requirements:
I have an class element called "card". When I hover the element, it should make background image 10% bigger.
Animation should not affect to the size of the "card" div. Animation duration should be 0.5s.

When mouse is moved away, the background image size should change back to normal.

I want to change CSS file only.

Code:
```
return (
    <div className="cards">
        {cards?.map((card) => {
            return (
                <div
                    className="card"
                    key={card.fields.title}
                    style={{
                        background: `url(${card.fields.image?.fields.file.url}) no-repeat center`,
                    }}
                >
                    {card.fields.title && card.fields.description && (
                        <div className="card-inner">
                            <div className="card-title">
                                {card.fields.showTitle && (
                                    <h1>{card.fields.title}</h1>
                                )}
                            </div>
                            <div className="card-text">
                                <p>{card.fields.description}</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    )}
                </div>
            );
        })}
    </div>
);
```

Style:
```
.card {
	@extend %roundedBox;
	display: flex;
	background-size: cover !important;
	padding: 50px 0 0;
	width: 400px;
	min-height: 500px;

	&-inner {
		align-self: flex-end;
		backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
		padding: 0 50px;
	}

	&-title {
		text-transform: uppercase;
	}

	&-text,
	&-title {
		color: white;
	}
}
```

To achieve the hover animation for your "card" element in React with the specified requirements, you can add a CSS class for the hover effect and use the `:hover` pseudo-class. Additionally, you can utilize the `transition` property to control the animation duration. Here's the modified CSS code:

```css
.card {
  @extend %roundedBox;
  display: flex;
  background-size: cover !important;
  padding: 50px 0 0;
  width: 400px;
  min-height: 500px;
  transition: background-size 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Added transition property */

  &-inner {
    align-self: flex-end;
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    padding: 0 50px;
  }

  &-title {
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }

  &-text,
  &-title {
    color: white;
  }

  &:hover {
    background-size: 110% !important; /* Increase background size on hover */
  }
}
```

In this code, I added the `transition` property to control the animation duration for the `background-size` property. The `ease-in-out` timing function provides a smooth transition effect. The `:hover` selector is used to define the styles that will be applied when the mouse hovers over the "card" element.

Make sure to adjust the `background-size` and other values according to your design preferences.

## Notes

-   Instant animation

## Prompt 2

```
Animation is working when I hover the "card" element, but there is no duration. Also, image does not get bigger when mouse is on the element: element size is the same, but image will appear without cropping, making it to look smaller.
```

## Response 2

I apologize for the oversight. It seems I missed a crucial detail in the implementation. To achieve the desired effect where the background image gets 10% bigger without affecting the size of the "card" div, you should adjust the `background-size` property using percentages. Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.card {
  @extend %roundedBox;
  display: flex;
  background-size: 100% 100% !important; /* Specify initial background size */
  padding: 50px 0 0;
  width: 400px;
  min-height: 500px;
  transition: background-size 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Added transition property */

  &-inner {
    align-self: flex-end;
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    padding: 0 50px;
  }

  &-title {
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }

  &-text,
  &-title {
    color: white;
  }

  &:hover {
    background-size: 110% 110% !important; /* Increase both width and height on hover */
  }
}
```

Here, I modified the `background-size` property in both the default and `:hover` states to specify both the width and height percentages. The `background-size: 100% 100%` ensures that the image covers the entire "card" div, and on hover, it increases by 10% both horizontally and vertically.

Please give this a try, and it should produce the intended hover effect.

## Notes 2

-   Animation is working
-   Image is narrow

![hover](./documents/Screenshot%202023-11-16%20183932.png)

## Prompt 3

```
The animation works now and it has correct duration. However, the image's aspect ratio is not correct: image looks more narrow and tall. What might cause this?
```

## Response 3

````
If the image's aspect ratio appears incorrect during the hover animation, it's possible that the aspect ratio of the image is not being maintained properly. To ensure the correct aspect ratio, you can set one of the dimensions (either width or height) explicitly and let the other dimension adjust accordingly.

Here's an updated version of the CSS:

```css
.card {
  @extend %roundedBox;
  display: flex;
  background-size: cover !important;
  padding: 50px 0 0;
  width: 400px;
  min-height: 500px;
  transition: background-size 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Added transition property */

  &-inner {
    align-self: flex-end;
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    padding: 0 50px;
  }

  &-title {
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }

  &-text,
  &-title {
    color: white;
  }

  &:hover {
    background-size: 110% 110% !important; /* Increase both width and height on hover */
  }

  & img {
    width: 100%; /* Ensure image takes up 100% width of its container */
    height: auto; /* Allow the height to adjust proportionally */
  }
}
```

In this updated code, I added a rule `& img` to ensure that the image inside the "card" div takes up 100% of the width, allowing the height to adjust proportionally. This should help maintain the correct aspect ratio during the hover animation. Adjust the width and height percentages as needed to achieve the desired visual effect.

## Notes 3

-   instant animation
-   image without hover looks normal
-   image with hover looks narrow

![hover](./documents/Screenshot%202023-11-16%20185426.png)

## Fix

```css
.card {
    @extend %roundedBox;
    display: flex;
->  background-size: auto 100% !important; /* Specify initial background size */
    padding: 50px 0 0;
    width: 400px;
    min-height: 500px;
    transition: background-size 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Added transition property */

    &-inner {
        align-self: flex-end;
        backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
        padding: 0 50px;
    }

    &-title {
        text-transform: uppercase;
    }

    &-text,
    &-title {
        color: white;
    }

    &:hover {
->      background-size: auto 110% !important; /* Increase both width and height on hover */
    }
}
```
